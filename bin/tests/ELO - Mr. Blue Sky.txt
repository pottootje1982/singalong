Sun is shinin' in the sky,\\There ain't a cloud in sight\\It's stopped rainin'\\Everybody's in a play\\And don't you know\\It's a beautiful new day.\\\\Runnin' down the avenue,\\See how the sun shines brightly\\In the city on the streets\\Where once was pity,\\Mr. blue sky is living here today.\\\\Chorus\\Mr. blue sky, please tell us why,\\You had to hide away\\For so long where did we go wrong.\\\\Hey there mr. blue\\We're so pleased to be with you\\Look around see what you do,\\Everybody smiles at you.\\\\Hey you with the pretty face,\\Welcome to the human race\\A celebration mr. blue sky's\\Up there waitin' and today\\Is the day we've waited for\\\\Chorus:repeat\\\\Mr. blue you did it right,\\But soon comes mr. night,\\Creepin' over, now his\\Hand is on your shoulder,\\Never mind i'll remember you this way.\\\\Chorus:repeat
